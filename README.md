Sharing a traffic analysis tool we built using YOLOv8 object detection.
This simple application helps count and track vehicles in video footage. It can:

Detect different vehicle types
Count vehicles crossing specific areas
Estimate vehicle speeds
Generate basic traffic flow visualizations

The tool aims to help traffic planners and researchers gather data more easily. It's still a work in progress, but we're hoping it might be useful for those needing straightforward traffic analysis.
